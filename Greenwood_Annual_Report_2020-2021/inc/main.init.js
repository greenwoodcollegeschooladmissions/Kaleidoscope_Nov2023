Students, staff and families had to quickly adapt to a new reality: hybrid learning for Grade 9-12 students, limited co-curricular activities, multiple school closures and stringent public health protocols. Greenwoods staff and school leadership did an amazing job providing the best educational experience possible given these trying circumstances, but it was certainly not the year for which we had hoped.With that in mind, I was delighted that Greenwood was able to return to full-time in-school learning for all students this September, and to safely reintroduce many of the experiences that make Greenwood special. Seeing photographs of students dribbling up the basketball court, exploring the outdoors at camp and working collaboratively in the classroom has filled me with joy, and I know it has done the same for our community. I look forward to the continued reintroduction of co-curriculars and all that they will add to the student experience.The 2021-2022 school year also brought the launch of Venture Further Together, the schools strategic plan for 2021-2026. The Greenwood Board and the Schools leadership team continued to work with Level5 Strategy throughout 2020-2021 to build this Strategic Plan using feedback from students, staff, parents and alumni and research on best practices from educational institutions around the world. The implementation of many of the Plans new initiatives is already underway. Venture Further Together builds upon Greenwoods unique character and approach to education, and the implementation of the Plans initiatives will distinguish Greenwood and move the school forward with purpose.I am deeply grateful for the continued financial support from current and past parents, grandparents, alumni, staff and friends. That support makes it possible for Greenwood to continue to go above and beyond, and it will be critical in the implementation of Venture Further Together. Thank you.I would also like to sincerely thank Greenwoods principal, Sarah Bruce, and our staff for working tirelessly to keep students learning and engaged during the pandemic. I would also like to thank our volunteers and Board of Directors for giving generously of their time and expertise.I am very optimistic that the months to come will bring a further return to normalcy, and I know that the years to come will bring even more exciting opportunities for Greenwood students.Donald LewtasChair, Greenwood College School Board of DirectorsGreenwood Annual Report 2020/2021 2'", "3": "b'PRINCIPALS MESSAGE SARAH BRUCEThe 2020-2021 school year was our final year under the guidance of the 2016-2021 strategic plan. The goal of this plan was to enhance Greenwoods ability to provide a customized learning experience for students and to encourage the building of character and community. Six priorities for Greenwood were identified; I am happy to report on our progress in all of these areas, and I look forward to reporting on the progress of our new plan, Venture Further Together, next year.1 Invest in the Greenwood Centre for Teaching and LearningLast year saw the expanded role of coaching within our teacher growth model. Nine experienced teachers opted for our project model to drive their growth, which involves choosing an aspect of student learning or well-being and completing an inquiry project on that area throughout the year. This shows significant investment in professional development, and that investment will be reflected in their teaching. We also formalized our mentoring program for new staff members; each mentor receives training before being paired with a mentee, and mentors roles with their mentees have been expanded. In keeping with Greenwoods commitment to health and well-being and to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, the Centre worked intentionally with Kathryn Connelly, Director, Student Well-being and Rachael Brownell-Swain, Director, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Outreach to ensure that those areas are woven into both teacher goals and teaching and learning. Given last years hybrid approach to learning for Grade 9-12 students, the Centre was actively involved in developing best practices for that model and supporting teachers in implementing those practices. The Centre also expanded the number of staff members completing coaching training through the Conference of Independent Schools (CIS); Greenwood is co-leading this effort in concert with fellow CIS schools.Greenwood Annual Report 2020/2021 3'", "4": "b'2 Manage the Transitionto Our New CampusWe have now fully settled into our renovated and expanded facility. However, we continue to take stock of our spaces and look for ways that they could be reimagined to provide additional functionality. For example, we added large breakout spaces to co-taught classrooms last year to better implement flexible grouping and to give co-teachers greater ability to customize their courses. Our new space was critical in light of the restrictions imposed by COVID-19. The large classrooms allowed us to safely hold classes of 15 students in Grades 9-12 while maintaining 2 metres of distance, and Grade 7 and 8 students were able to be in school every day while maintaining the required 1 metre of distance. This would not have been possible without our expanded building. We also made several temporary changes to the building as a result of the pandemic last year, including directional signage, sinks throughout the building and capacity limits.Greenwood Annual Report 2020/2021 4'", "5": "b'3 Address the Changing Needs of Students Across the GradesWe continued our work on diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging last year, ensuring that this work was tailored to each grades age and stage. This included workshops, in-class activities and incorporating ideas and concepts related to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging into the curriculum. Recognizing that personalized learning also looks different at each age and stage, we made great strides in adapting the personalized delivery of course material based on grade level. Fluidity of assessment and evaluation became a larger focus last year; fluid assessment and evaluation practices allow students to demonstrate their ongoing learning and development of skills throughout a unit or course, and not just at the end with a traditional test.Effective self-advocacy is a skill we want to help every Greenwood student develop. Students need to know when to ask for help, and what type of help to ask for, to support their continued learning and growth. We worked on this skill with all students last year, teaching them how to look at their assessments and to determine what their next steps should be based on their results. We also introduced the Leveled Assessment program, in which Grade 7 students received levels, rather than grades, on their progress reports. Research demonstrates that when a leveled grading system is used, students are more intrinsically motivated and more open to receiving and acting on feedback to support growth.Greenwood Annual Report 2020/2021 5'", "6": "b'4 Enhance our StudentAdviser ProgramThe value that Greenwoods Adviser program adds to our community was more evident than ever in 2020-2021. Our Advisers are experts in working with students at particular ages and stages and they provided a safe space for their advisees, ably supporting their academic, social-emotional and mental health needs throughout hybrid and online learning last year. They introduced initiatives and programming challenging their advisees to get moving, to talk to each other and to make connections. Advisers were also key in helping students manage online learning, acting as the first point of contact for students and families and meeting with advisees multiple times a week to provide guidance and support.In March 2021, we introduced Adviser conferences for all students. These Parent-Guardian/Teacher conferences focused on student participation in the Greenwood community and growth in moral, civic, intellectual and performance character, with parents/guardians and Advisers discussing next steps for student growth both within and beyond the classroom. Students also worked with their Advisers to create comments for the June 2021 Adviser reports; in these comments, they reflected on their growth over the school year and identified next steps for their continued growth.Greenwood Annual Report 2020/2021 6'", "7": "b'5 Educate our Communityon the Core Principlesof Well-BeingLast year saw the appointment of Greenwoods first Director of Student Well-being, Kathryn Connelly. Kathryn worked throughout the school year to develop programming for both students and staff that focused on supporting mental, physical and emotional well-being. Well-being lessons and practices were integrated into classroom lesson cycles and became an integral part of classes. Advisers also implemented lessons designed by School Mental Health Ontario in partnership with the Ontario Physical and Health Education Association; the focus of these lessons was providing educators and students with tools to promote wellness during challenging times, support student mental health and encourage help-seeking when a mental health problem arises. We welcomed many external speakers into the school virtually to speak to staff, students and parents, including education and well-being expert Dr. David Tranter. In November 2020, we launched our MOVEmber initiative, which promoted the benefits of movement and physical health to our community (and which we repeated in 2021-2022). Kathryn also supported staff throughout the year with ongoing well-being professional development and initiatives such as a movement challenge and online fitness classes. Finally, we hired Shai Kohen, our new full-time social worker, in Spring 2021; Shai began work this September.Greenwood Annual Report 2020/2021 7'", "8": "b'6 Create More Opportunitiesfor Graduates and Their Families to Stay Connected with GreenwoodThe 2020-2021 school year was the second full year for our Alumni Executive. This dedicated group has continued to make progress in building the base for a robust alumni program. A major accomplishment for the Executive last year was launching Greenwood Alumni Connect, our new online alumni hub. This hub allows alumni to network with each other based on criteria such as location, school and industry. It also hosts Greenwoods Mentorship Program, job and internship opportunities, event information and more. Over 25% of Greenwoods alumni have already joined and found value in this platform, and we look forward to continuing to build Alumni Connect in the years to come. The Executive also hosted two very successful panel discussions for alumni and other members of the Greenwood community: one on the power of sport, and one on the power of well-being.Recognizing that some of our youngest alumni were finding it challenging to adjust to postsecondary life in the time of COVID, Greenwood offered support sessions for the Classes of 2019 and 2020 with school guidance counselors and our social worker last year. We also welcomed a record number of alumni speakers for our annual Careers Morning; as this event was held virtually, we could include alumni living outside of Toronto in cities such as Calgary, Los Angeles and London. In addition, we had an alumnus join us for a teaching placement and we will continue to offer support to alumni training to be teachers in the future.Greenwood Annual Report 2017/2020 8'", "9": "b'REVENUE AND EXPENSES:GREENWOOD COLLEGE SCHOOLREVENUE BREAKDOWN for the year ended June 30, 202193 %Fees3 % Contributions4 % Other RevenueEXPENSES BREAKDOWN for the year ended June 30, 2021STUDENT LEARNING AND PROGRAMS4 %Academic and Co-Curricular Programs67 %Teacher Compensation2 %Information & Communications TechnologySUPPORT 2 %Administration & External Relations16 %Staff Compensation9 %FacilitiesGreenwood Annual Report 2017/2020 9'", "10": "b'FUNDRAISING REPORT:GREENWOOD COLLEGE SCHOOLAND GREENWOOD COLLEGE SCHOOL FOUNDATIONThis past year again provedof greatest need.
