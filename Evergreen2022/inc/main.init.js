Some of you enrolled because you and your family shared our founders vision for Greenwood back in 2002, before there was even a physical school building; some of you joined following our expansion and renovation in 2016, when our updated building opened up even more possibilities; and many of you joined at points along that path, as the school grew and flourished. You joined because you wanted to be both challenged and supported, or because you valued experiential learning, or because you wanted a school that wasnt afraid to do things differently (or maybe all three).Our commitment to our founding values has remained constant over the last 20 years. No matter when or why you joined Greenwood, you were part of a community where teachers get to know students as learners and as people, where students find energy in both success and challenge, and where alumni choose and follow the paths that will bring them fulfillment. We have evolved since 2002, but that evolution comes from our recognition that we can always do better for our students by deepening our understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing us from day to day and from year to year.We remain a close-knit community, and I have heard over and over again from alumni that the people are what made their time at our school truly specialthat the friendships they made have endured long since graduation, and that their teachers pushed them to fulfil their potential while always having their backs. Building and strengthening those relationships is at the core of everything we do, and we are committed to ensuring that Greenwood is a warm and welcoming environment forevery student who walks through our doors.Twenty years after the schools founding, we are celebrating all that we have accomplished since 2002. Greenwood has been a consistent leader among Toronto independent schools, pioneering personalized learning for all and embedding Outdoor Education as a core part of the curriculum. As we look towards the future, we are dedicated to maintaining this entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to experiential learning, and to constantly looking for ways to improve the Greenwood experience for our students (see pages 4-5 for exciting developments on this front).Greenwood has evolved since its founding, and will continue to evolvebut the values that drive us every day?

This land will not onlymeet our immediate need for green space, but will give us valuable room to think and dream for the future.What have we purchased?With prudent financial management and support from our community, Greenwood was able to purchase the plot of land encompassing the KFC and Wolseley Plumbing located south of the school on Mount Pleasant Road; we have also purchased four houses on Balliol Street. These properties will yield a lot sized at 63,000 square feet.What are we planning to build?Greenwood plans to develop a multi-purpose recreation space on the site that will meet a wide variety of student needs. The highlight of these new facilities will be an artificial turf playing field that will be converted into an artificial ice rink during the winter months. For Grizzlies athletes, this is a game changer. Teams will now be able to hold practices directly across the street from the school, turning travel time into valuable skill-building time. These facilities will also be available for use by our physical education classes for activities like soccer, flag football, rugby, hockey, ice skating and more.Additionally, our new recreation space will include an outdoor classroom, multi-use recreation space and washroom facilities.

When the Ontario government introduced the new curriculum in 2000, they also brought in TAPthe teacher-adviser program. The idea was that teacher-advisers would meet with their advisees regularly and help them make informed choices at key transition points in their schooling.Greenwood is always looking for ways to build upon our programming, and TAP was no exception. Our Adviser program started as a quick daily touch-base between students and their Advisers; today, this program provides unparalleled support for students throughout their time at Greenwood.The Adviser is a caring adult who will both support and champion students individual needs, says Heather Thomas,Vice-Principal, Deputy Head of School. This role is incredibly important because Advisers work with individual studentsto help them grow in any way that is needed, whether that be in the area of study skills, well-being practices, self-advocacy, or collaboration with others. Advisers truly care about their advisees and work to ensure that they have a personalized experience at Greenwood.Check out the timeline on the next page to see how the Adviser program has evolved over the last 20 years.The Adviser program helps me with my school work and makes me feel like my thoughts are heard and taken into consideration. My Adviser is very helpful when it comes to my worries and helps me understand myself a little more.Ellie Yantsulis 27I enjoy being an Adviser because I get the chance to really get to know that group of students. The opportunity to build that connection between a student and an Adviser is special.As a Grade 7-8 Adviser, its rewarding to see my advisees growth throughout the two years that theyre with me, from their first day at Greenwood to entering high school.

Parents and guardians receive a comment from the Adviser on their childs quarterly report cards, but Adviser meetings do not include structured programming.2008-2011 Adviser meetings take place after school two days per week. Advisers check in with advisees and offer support as needed. Students who do not need homework support are exempt from the program. For a brief time during this period, Adviser is connected to the House Program, with all advisees in a group coming from the same House to create a school life connection; as theprogram continues to evolve, this becomes untenable and is discontinued, as it does not meetthe schools goal of personalizing learning for students.2011-2012 2011 brings several realizations that will have major implications for the Adviser program: Our Student Success Centre (SSC) offers outstanding support to students working withThe relationships betweenthe SSC regularly, but every student can benefit from personalized support.

When I spoke to my university friends about their high school experiences, they said they wouldnt do it over againbut I felt the exact opposite way! Ive always had such an incredible connection to the school and as soon as I knew I wanted to become a teacher, it was a no-brainer that I would pursue Greenwood. The individualized learning and teaching philosophies here are one aspect that I love, but the community feel and Outdoor Education programs are so brilliantly special and truly unmatched. How has Greenwood changed since you were a student? How has it stayed the same?Other than there being an entirely new half of the building, it honestly feels like I never left! Even when I was in university, I felt so connected to the community that coming back as a teacher was seamless. Greenwood continues to deliberately work to improve the student experience, which in turn has incredibly positive impacts on the staff experience.

When did you know you wanted to become a teacher?I always had the idea in the back of my mind, but I wasnt certain I wanted to pursue teaching until I worked in Greenwoods Main Office as an administrative assistant in the winter of 2016. I found that I really loved the energy around the school,and that was when I decided to apply to teachers college.What drew you to come back to Greenwood to teach?The energy that Greenwood has is special. As a student, I loved the opportunities and programs that were available to me;I wanted to be a part of giving those opportunities back to students. How has Greenwood changed since you were a student? How has it stayed the same?Because I started as a student when Greenwood was only in its second year, a lot has changed! Physically, the buildingis totally different. A lot has also changed with regards to the extracurricular opportunities available, including theOutdoor Education program, sports and clubs. However, so much about the culture has stayed the same. What has it been like working with staff members who were here when youwere a student?This was definitely a huge adjustment when I started! Having to shift how I referred to other staff members (from callingthem Mr. or Ms., to using their first name) was definitely strange at first, but now Im much more used to it. Now that Ima few years in, I dont think about that nearly as much as I did in my first year or two!What is your favourite part about working here?Just like when I was a student, the best thing is still the people. The care that the staff members provide not only tothe students but also to one another is really special. I know that I am supported as a teacher, just as much as I knewI was supported as a student.

Here are four Greenwood grads who have chosen to work in fields related to sustainability.p KRISTEN ELDER 13Kristen is the Bike Education Instructor Manager at HUB Cycling in Vancouver, BC. HUB is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to removing barriers to cycling in Metro Vancouver while cultivating the health, environmental, and economic benefits of active transportation.Shortly after she graduated from the University of Guelph, Kristen was invited on a cross-Canada road trip heading to Vancouverand she didnt need much convincing to say yes. Although I didnt know much about Vancouver, I knew it was surrounded by water, trees, mountains and bicycles, she said. That was enough for me!Before moving out west, biking was just another recreational activity for Kristen. I bought my first adult bicycle a few months before my road trip, she says. I told myself that no matter what, I was going to use this new bike as my primary means of transport. That dedication led her to jump at the opportunity to join HUB Cycling as a Bike Education Instructor; instructors teach a variety of bike safety courses, including Bike to School programs. It was a job that would introduce me to the world of active transportation and build on my previous work as an outdoor educatorsold! she says.More than three years and three roles later, Kristen continues to enjoy working with HUB as the organizations Bike Education Instruction Manager. She now scouts, hires, trains, manages and advocates for about 25 seasonal Bike Education Instructors, in addition to refining HUBs curriculums and building new resources. HUB is a small but mighty non-profit organization operated by wholesome and dedicated staff on a mission to get more people cycling more often, she says. I believe riding a bicycle is a fundamental skill that everyone should know, and I am proud to play a measurable part in helping others uncover the vast benefits of cycling for themselves.Kristen has seen HUBs work have a significant impact on the community. The organization has delivered programming to over 13,000 people already this year, but to realize the true impact of that reach, I often talk about the ripples, Kristen says. It can start with putting a bike in the hands of one student, newcomer to Canada, or adult for the first time, and witnessing how a little guidance and encouragement has them pedalling within the hour. These are some of the most gratifying moments of my job because I know this is only the first ripple. A new skill has been unlocked, their family and friends will hear about it, and there will be bike rides in that persons future. Those subsequent, exponential ripples build a community of happier and healthier people.What advice does Kristen have for someone interested in getting into cycling or bike commuting? Dont overthink it! she says. All you need is a bicycle and a helmet. Make sure the bicycle is safe to ride by inspecting it or bringing it to a bike shop for a tune up, and then start small and work your way up. If youre looking to rekindle your interest in biking, plan a fun excursion to a local park or coffee shop. If youre curious about commuting by bicycle, try choosing one day a week or month to bike to school or work.Kristen appreciates the emphasis placed on outdoor education at Greenwood. Those experiences grew my love for being active outdoors and opened my eyes to incredible places like BC, she says. But more than that, they validated the exceptional skill building and personal growth that can come from taking students out beyond the walls of the classroom. That has helped me believe even more strongly in the impact of the work Im doing right now.As HUB Cyclings Bike Education Instruction Manager, Kristen Elder 13 scouts, hires, trains, manages, and advocates for about 25 seasonal Bike Education Instructors, in addition to refining HUBs curriculums and building new resources.12 evergreen Dec. 2022GRWD211_Evergreen_2022 r4.indd 12 2023-01-12 11:51 AM'", "15": "b'q MAX ROBINSON 16Max is a junior water resources engineer at Golder Associates.

She plans to become a teacher.The idea of studying sustainability resonated with Erin most strongly during her time at Greenwood. It was a combination of the Green Industries and Regional Geography courses that first inspired me, Erin says. Greenwoods project-based Regional Geography course is integrated with the Grade 11 Fall Outdoor Education trip to British Columbia. Learning about the history and interconnected ecosystem of Kyuquot Sound and getting to know the Kyuquot and Checleseht First Nation families was a treasure, she says. Erin then worked at West Coast Expeditions, the outfitter running the Regional Geography trip, the following summer. That time in my life amounted to a huge shift for my future and determined my academic and future career paths, Erin says.Erins postsecondary journey took her to the east coast, where she studied Sustainability, History and Indigenous Studies at the University of Kings College and Dalhousie University. During her time in Halifax, she became interested in the citys Climate Action Plan through an interview and conversation she had with the founder of iMatter Halifax, Lily Baraclough; iMatter is a youth climate action organization that works to hold local governments accountable for their inaction on climate change. I was inspired that, as young adults, we can have a voice and hold our representatives accountable, Erin says. Erin joined iMatter just after they had successfully pushed to ban plastic bags city-wide. The group continued to meet regularly with various city councillors to advocate for climate policy; Erin was nervous to be involved in these meetings at first, but shes glad she pushed through. It was a good experience in arguing ones case with researched arguments to steer a decision in ones favour, she says.Erins studies taught her that even sustainable solutions arent perfect or carbon neutral. While this is difficult information to process, she feels its important to know. For example, lithium batteries are rechargeable, but creating them can disrupt marine ecosystems and species. However, that doesnt mean we shouldnt enact change, Erin says. Moreover, we must learn from communities and cultures, both past and present, to find solutions that work with the environment and arent as harmful to the planet. Racial discrimination in environmental policy-making is a related issue that Erin feels should be spoken of more. A great book on this topic is Theres Something in the Water by Ingrid Waldron, a sociology and health professor at Dalhousie who collaborated on a documentary with Elliot Page on the issue, Erin says. As a future educator, Erin hopes to take the experiential learning approach used by Greenwood classes such as Green Industries and Regional Geography. Its one thing to be taught from a textbook and through slideshows, but its another to go out into the field and learn, she says. Meeting people and hearing their stories is far more impactful. Most importantly, Erin wants to foster students passions, love of learning and belief in their own abilities. I wasnt always a high-achieving student, Erin says. Due to auditory processing delays and my struggle with mathematics, I gave up on myself. The arts and humanities werent valued at my school prior to Greenwood, and so I felt less-than and incapable. I dont want any other student to feel that way. Sometimes it takes finding a topic you love to see the path forward. I would not have achieved Double Honours if it werent for professors, teachers, and mentors believing in me.The idea of studying sustainability resonated with Erin Appelbe 17 most strongly during her time at Greenwood, particularly in her Green Industries and Regional Geography classes.14 evergreen Dec. 2022GRWD211_Evergreen_2022 r4.indd 14 2023-01-12 11:51 AM'", "17": "b'New Studying abroad can open Ventures doors to new opportunities and experiences.

However, he learned to code in his senior years at Greenwoodand that new learning ignited a spark. The general philosophy was for students to take control of their learning, Owen says of Greenwoods approach. I was encouraged to be curious and to seek opportunities to be technically creative.Owen went on to study Computer Science at McGill University. In his third year, he began to seriously focus his attention on machine learning. What piqued my interest was the vast applications of artificial intelligence, he says. I became fascinated with how computers learn and how we can leverage their power to solve real-world issues. I also found that I could incorporate my other hobbies into my coding projects in a way that I had never explored before. This curiosity compelled Owen to take more machine learning courses and seek out research opportunities.Today, Owen works for Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. He works in the Supply Chain Division, helping to implement and maintain algorithms to determine how packages are spread amongst warehouses. Our teams algorithms use various machine learning models, Owen says. These algorithms aid Amazons global supply chain by distributing packages across warehouses based on a list of constraints like demand and storage. Its a critical component of Amazons flagship website, and Im honoured to be working on it.One of Owens long-term goals is to join Googles DeepMind team. DeepMind is on the leading edge of artificial intelligence, demonstrating the awesome power of machine learning; in 2020, DeepMind made headlines with its AlphaFold program, which can determine a proteins 3D shape from its amino-acid sequence. I have been following DeepMinds research since they released AlphaStar in 2019; AlphaStar is a self-learning AI designed to play the video game StarCraft 2 with the capability to defeat professional players, Owen says.

Weve had lots of cottage time and camping the past three summers, so cant complain.

Ms. Porter has recently moved from being a math teacher to the guidance department and continues her work on student leadership development in the senior grades. Mr. Brown continues to teach drama, advertising and philosophyand, of course, can often be found sharing his love of music and film with anyone and everyone in the hallways and through our clubs. In 2021, Mr. Brown and Ms. Porters youngest daughter, Maddie, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. It has been a challenging journey learning to manage a chronic illness and becoming advocates for the safe care and wellbeing of their child. It is not a journey, however, that they have begun alone. The Greenwood community continues to be a place of immense support and care. The students, their families and Greenwood staff who know about Maddies diagnosis frequently offer them words of encouragement, demonstrate a thoughtful understanding of their situation and help them to manage the additional load that their lives now have. It reminds them how the relationships fostered at Greenwood truly are the heart of the school and they are extremely grateful. They wish all their former students the best.
