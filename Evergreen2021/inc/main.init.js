As I go, I pay close attention to students. Where do they like to be? Who are they sitting or chatting with? Are they building new friendships? Are they calm or frantically trying to get things done? And, most importantly, how are they feeling?While these pulse checks are hugely informative for me, they also give me the opportunity to soak in the spirit of Greenwood. In 2020-2021, these walks often served as harsh reminders of all that COVID had taken from our students; it sometimes seemed impossible to fathom getting back to normal. But over the last several weeks, pulse checks have once again become a highlight of my day. Our students and staff are so happy to be back in the building together, and that feeling has made the ongoing restrictions imposed by COVID easier to bear. Co-curriculars have restarted, and planning beyond the next week or two has begun to seem feasible. A sense of normalcy is returning, however slowlyand for that, I am truly grateful.Though it was notable in many waysboth positive and negativethe 2020-2021 school year also marked the completion of Venture Further, Greenwoods strategic plan for 2016-2021.

The overall goal of this plan is to build on Greenwoods whole-student educational experience to make it the best of its kind, while also bringing that experience to even more students.Throughout the planning process, we received valuable input from students, staff, alumni and parents and guardians through focus groups, surveys and feedback sessions. This input helped us to identify five key strategic imperatives that will guide us over the next five years, including creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive community that fosters a sense of belonging. It is our hope that our alumni are willing to be part of this work, and that these strategic imperatives can in turn make a positive impact on Greenwoods alumni community. You can read more about our 2021-2026 Strategic Plan on page 3.There is exciting, important work to be done over the next five years, and I look forward to doing it in the spirit of this plan: together.Sarah Bruce, PrincipalNovember 2021Greenwood1'", "4": "b'Message from Our Alumni ExecutiveGreenwood Alumni Community,We hope that you and your families are doing well.

He got our Athletics program off the ground in our early years, using his network to make key connections with other independent schools and lending his considerable expertise as a basketball coach to all age levels. He was also a valued mentor to younger Greenwood teachers; he guided them with his experience every step of the way, even accompanying Janelle Watson to her first Athletic Director meeting when she took on the role to show her the ropes. He also ran North Toronto Basketball, where he and his son coached youth basketball players.

We encourage graduating students and their families to direct their Annual Appeal gifts to their Class Fund. Most funds support student financial assistance; other areas of support include the Greenwood Centre for Teaching and Learning, the schools area of greatest need and experiential learning programs.Over the years, these funds have supported many current Greenwood students whose financial situations have changed during their time at the school, allowing them to continue their Greenwood experience. The funds have also supported enhancements to our experiential learning programs, valuable professional development opportunities for our teachers and more. We are very grateful for this generous support from our community and the many opportunities it has made possible for our students and staff. Our Class Funds are established when each new Grade 7 class joins the school, and our hope is that parents, alumni and past parents will help their Class Funds to grow in the years to come. This continued support will leave a lasting legacy from each graduating class to the school and make a real difference for students and staff in the years to come.See the chart below for a summary of each Class Fund and what it supports.

Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are an imperative of Greenwoods new Strategic Plan, and we will continue to share our progress in this area with our community and to provide opportunities for involvement and feedback from all stakeholders.For more information on last years work in the areas of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, visit greenwoodcollege.org/DEI.Land AcknowledgementOne of last years most important initiatives was the creation of a new Land Acknowledgement for Greenwood. We learned that Land Acknowledgements must be created in consultation with Indigenous communities, and with considerable thought about what the acknowledgement means to the school, in order to be meaningful and actionable, and our previous acknowledgement did not meet those criteria.Greenwood is situated on the Ancestral territories of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, Anishinabek and the Wendake. In the process of creating a new acknowledgement, Greenwood researched these nations to learn more about them; we also worked with Christine Luckasavitch of Waaseyaa Consulting, who asked us the questions that we needed to be asked in order to create something that is honest and respectful.Our new Land Acknowledgement is below. In addition to being read daily on our announcements, we will also give voice to this acknowledgement when away from the school on trips to honour the lands we visit.We acknowledge with gratitude the Ancestral lands upon which our main campus is situated. These lands are the Ancestral territories of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, Anishinabek and the Wendake. The shared responsibility of this land is honoured in the Dish with One Spoon Treaty and as settlers, we strive to care for the land, the waters, and all creatures in the spirit of peace. We are responsible for respecting and supporting the enduring presence of all First Nations, Mtis and Inuit peoples. When away from this campus we vow to be respectful to the land by protecting and honouring it. We will create relationships with the people and the land we may visit by understanding the territories we enter and the nations who inhabit them.Engaging with DEI initiatives became an in-class expectation last year, with lessons and conversations embedded into classroom learning.8 evergreen Nov. 2021'", "11": "b'Reconciliatory ActionIn 2020-2021, Greenwood held a Week of Reconciliatory Action. This week featured a number of speakers including Alexandra Biron 11, who identifies as Anishinaabe/Ojibway and is currently Senior Manager, Indigenous at Deloitte. Students were encouraged to reflect on their learning in multiple ways throughout the week. We also recognized Orange Shirt Day on September 30, asking students and staff to wear orange to remember the horrific impacts of Residential Schools. In 2021-2022, our focus on Indigenous communities and reconciliation was expanded to an Indigenous Identities Month, with a focus on Indigenous perspectives woven into the classroom and into events for the month of September. Incorporating these perspectives into curriculum in all subjects continues to be a focus.We would also like to note that our current work in this area is in many ways the culmination of work by James Southey 19, who originally suggested that Greenwood participate in Orange Shirt Day during his time at the school. Since that time, our focus on Indigenous history and narratives has broadened from one day to a focused month, with many threads running throughout the year. Thank you, James!Adapting to COVID-19As Grade 9-12 students learned from home on alternate days last year (and our whole campus was virtual for many weeks), our approach to moving diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging forward had to evolve. Engaging with DEI initiatives became an in-class expectation last year, with lessons and conversations embedded into classroom learning. Events such as Pride, Black History Month and International Womens Day were also observed through explicit curriculum connections.Staff Professional DevelopmentGreenwood staff participated in several workshops and professional development opportunities last year related to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. Two teams of teachers worked on weaving diverse perspectives into the curriculum across several subjects, while Professional Learning and Development teams ran throughout the year. Staff members also participated in several workshops, including three sessions facilitated by The Collective, a Black-owned consultancy group that provides diversity, equity, inclusion and justice professional development. Certified coaches Demore Barnes and Shauna Barnes also worked with Greenwood staff members on diversity, equity and inclusion last year and will run two workshops for the broader community in 2021-2022. Our Work for 2021-2022Creating a diverse, equitable and inclusive community at Greenwood is a major focus of our new strategic plan. Here are a few details on how were planning to move that work forward this year.Rachael Brownell-Swain is Greenwoods new Director, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Outreach.

She is using several measurement tools in her work, most notably an adapted version of the Reimagining Integration: Diverse and Equitable Schools (RIDES) assessment created by Harvard University. The data collected will provide us with a road map on next steps in diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging and help us to measure our progress over time.Bethany Glick, who works with students on our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, is now our Coordinator, Inclusion & Belonging. Rachael and Bethany, along with Erin Porter, Director, Student Life, have created themes for each of this years terms that tie together the DEI work for that term. For example, Term 1 is Identities, with the first three months of the year focusing on Indigenous identities, 2SLGBTQ+ identities and the legacy of identity, respectively. The themes for Terms 2 and 3 are Belonging and Community. Each term will begin with community-building activities related to empathy, encouraging students to truly consider others perspectives and reflect on how they can be effective allies.We look forward to continuing to share our progress with you on this ongoing journey. Each term this year will have a theme that ties together the work on diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging for that term; within the Identities theme, we focused on 2SLGBTQ+ identities in October.Greenwood9'", "12": "b'The Evolution of AcademicsMeeting each students individual learning needs has always been at the heart of Greenwoodbut how we do that has evolved significantly over the past 19 years.We asked four long-standing Greenwood staff members how academics havechanged during their time at the school.Interviewed for this article:kBill Farbstein, Coordinator, Innovation LabkElanna Robson, Director, AcademicskHeather Thomas, Vice-Principal, Deputy Head of SchoolkJanelle Watson, Director, Grade 7 & 8How has Greenwoods academic approach shifted during your time at the school? What drove those shifts?Heather: When the Student Success Centre (SSC) was founded, it was quite revolutionaryBill Farbsteinin that it was a space where students with learning differences could get support. Today, Greenwoods Adviser program for all students is now modelled on ideas that originated in the SSC. Identifying individual strengths and areas for growth, and then supporting students as they develop within those areas, is a key focus for Advisers, and that all started with the SSC.Bill: Theres a greater focus on gauging students interests and using that to design course material and drive learning. This helps students dive deeper into the strands of a subject that they love, but still allows teachers to assess the same skills for every student. In Technology courses, for example, students can make a project that interests them using woodworking, 3D printing and design, but I can still mark each project using the same criteria.Elanna: Weve moved from a focus on differentiation to more refined and targeted personalization. This came out of a desire for more responsive teaching and a focus on developing our students into more proficient self-directed learners.Janelle: While Greenwoods emphasis on Outdoor Education hasnt changed, our approach to planning camp days has become more streamlined. The programming has evolved to engage with nature and all of the learning opportunities camp offers instead of running traditional classes during that time. Elanna RobsonWhat is a curricular achievement or project of which youre particularly proud?Janelle: Successfully implementing the 20-Time Project in Grade 11 Learning Strategies was a highlight for me. Each student chose a project to work on bi-weekly for the year, and some students noted it as the most memorable part of their year. From knife making, to drone building, to learning Portuguese, each student found value in the time spent.Heather: When we shifted to personalized learning, we also introduced courses that were offered using a blended learning approach, which combines technology-rich resources and in-person learning. The idea was to use technology to provide a personalized experience (e.g. by allowing students to work through a unit at their own pace). While we no longer offer blended courses, we have kept the best of what we learned from them and we have layered a strong technology component into all of our courses.Bill: I loved being part of the design and building of the Innovation Lab. I worked with Heather Thomas, Jonathan Tepper and Michael Schmidt to design the room and select the equipment; I also wrote the Grade 11 Technology course. I remember my Grade 7 Technology teacher and everything I learned from him so well, and the fact that I helped to build a technology spaceHeather Thomas and that I can now help students realize their potential in that spaceis enormous for meprofessionally.Elanna: The Business Department started the Greenwood Case Competition in 2012, and it has grown and evolved significantly since then. Solving a real-world business problem is not only authentic, but it simulates the type of case analysis students will be expected to do in postsecondary or in their careers. Students now receive significant training for case competitions throughout Senior Business courses, and they also receive feedback on their analysis and mentoring during competitions from a business professional.Where do you see academics at Greenwood going in the years to come?Elanna: We are going to continue to develop our assessment and evaluation practices with a focus on authentic tasks and something weve termed fluidity of assessment and evaluation. These practices will allow our students to engage more with the actual work of the discipline and demonstrate their ongoing learning and development of skills throughout a unit/course (not just at the end with a traditional test).Janelle Watson10 evergreen Nov. 2021'", "13": "b'Janelle: Greenwood is progressive. Period. Wherever academics are heading, Greenwood will no doubt be at the forefront! Being on the leading edge can be challenging for teachers at times, but the benefits for student learning are profound. We continue to research best practices in order to implement a personalized approach wherever possible. This helps build the wonderfully academically diverse community Greenwood is known for.Heather: More opportunities for experiential learning are going to be key. For example, courses can be connected to Outdoor Education (such as our Regional Geography course) or Service Learning to provide opportunities to apply concepts in the real world. Another goal is to have more experts come into courses to mentor students, as we do with our Writer in Residence program in Writers Craft.Bill: I think we will see technology continue to be incorporated into the classroom, but in different ways. We learned over the past 18 months that too much time spentTheres a greater focus on on screens can be detrimental to learning.

My passion keeps me focused and motivated to be the best I can be for both myself and my clients.While working at a brokerage one summer while attending postsecondary studies, Celia used the opportunity to network with realtors. It was there that she met her mentor and confidant, Armin Yousefi. After Celia left the brokerage to return to her studies, Armin offered her a place on his team when she was licensed and ready. Since then, she has had the privilege of both learning from and working with him. Celia started her career in real estate at a very pivotal timeduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Being a young professional starting in a new career has its own challenges, but top that with a province-wide lockdown and it seems impossible, Celia recalls of when she first launched her career in 2021.

She now works in the UK civil service as the policy lead for multilateral trade and climate policy in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Isabels passion for policy work was nurtured during her time as an undergrad at UofT, where she worked closely with the late, great political scientist, Dr. Stephen Clarkson.

After her studies at UofT and Cambridge University, she spent three years working in the international development sector at a reproductive health charity.

The UK has set ambitious targets of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions of 68% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 78% by 2035. Isabels role is at the intersection of trade and climate policy, working to ensure that the UKs multilateral trade policy (at the World Trade Organization and other key organisations) reflects and is compatible with the UKs climate ambition.

She worked for over three years in the Canadian government, most recently as a Senior Policy Advisor to the Federal Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry. Celine has since left the Ministers office and is currently working as an Economist/Policy Analyst in the OECDs Artificial Intelligence Unit in Paris, France. Celines previous experience working in government at the municipal and provincial levels made her want to see how key policy decisions were made at the federal level. Linking to her previous role at the UN protecting intellectual property rights and economic development, she felt that the portfolio of the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry was well suited to her interests and had great opportunities for growth and learning. In her role as Senior Policy Advisor, she provided advice to the Federal Minister on issues relating to innovation and economic development, including intellectual property, clean technology, investment attraction, and more. Her day-to-day tasks consisted of briefing the Minister on key issues, preparing speaking points for cabinet meetings and project announcements, and liaising with stakeholders across the country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she was advising the Ministers office on how to develop Canadas industrial response to COVID-19 by shifting efforts to increase Canadas domestic capacity for personal protective equipment (PPE) and investments into Canadian vaccines and therapeutics.Celine with Canadas Minister of Justice, David Lametti,Working in federal politics is both extremely exciting and challenging, who she worked closely with on intellectual propertyCeline says. You work grueling hours and you must always be alert and issues as ISED Parliamentary Secretary. reactive to evolving issues and global events. Her favourite part of her role is having a direct impact on shaping national economic policy to improve the lives of Canadians. The most challenging aspect of her job has been finding work-life balance. Celine remembers that her time at Greenwood helped to instill a strong sense of community service and respect for the environment through the schools values and outreach programs. These formative experiences ultimately led me to pursue a career in shaping Canadian public policy, where I can help to tackle some of our biggest national challenges, Celine fondly recalls.Celine stands in the Parliaments centre block in the old building before it was closed for renovations.Greenwood19'", "22": "b'Community SnapshotsTake a look at some memorable moments from another remarkable year at Greenwood!Grade 11 English students wore fun outfits to act out Inherit the Wind with their online peers.Greenwood families posed for a photo before running the Terry Fox Run in their respective neighbourhoods.Registration DayOur Grade 7s had fun learning about predator and Greenwood students and staffprey relationships during Grade 7 Integration Week.enjoyed hanging out on the Terrace for fresh air and sunshine.Great Scott!
